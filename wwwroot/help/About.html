      <!-- Version Numbers are not yet clear, and the system is not yet split into "Terria" and Nat Map. Re-instante this
        when it is set up properly. Probably in April.

      <p>The <strong>NationalMap</strong> is a website for map-based access to spatial data from Australian government agencies.
      It is an initiative of the Australian Commonwealth Government's Department of Communications and the software has been
      developed by NICTA working closely with the Department of Communications, Geoscience Australia and other government agencies.</p>

      <p>The <strong>NationalMap</strong> is a fully open architecture. When you access data through it, you are typically
      accessing the data directly from the government department or agency which is the custodian of that data.</p>

      <p>The <strong>NationalMap</strong>...</p>
      <ul>
         <li>provides easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and the public.</li>
         <li>facilitates the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies.</li>
         <li>provides an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To see what data is available on the NationalMap, refer to the Data Catalogue in the
      <a href="http://nationalmap.nicta.com.au/">NationalMap</a> itself. Click the <b>Data Catalogue</b> tab and expand the Data Set group names.</p>

      <h2>How to use the NationalMap</h2>

      <p>Just go to <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/">http://nationalmap.gov.au/</a>. Most operations are obvious,
      but you can click the <a href="Help.html">Help</a> button for specific instructions.</p>

      <p>For further information email <a href="mailto:nationalmap@communications.gov.au">nationalmap@communications.gov.au</a>.
      Feel free to send us feedback and bug reports.

      <h2>Contributing Data to NationalMap</h2>

      <p>Spatial data sets which are placed on <a href="http://data.gov.au/" target="_blank" >data.gov.au</a> using supported data formats and
      protocols (such as WMS) will
      automatically be included in the NationalMap. See the <a href="HowTo.html" >How To...</a> page for more information.</p>

      <p>Australian government agencies that wish to find out more information about contributing data sets to the NationalMap
      should email <a href="mailto:nationalmap@communications.gov.au">nationalmap@communications.gov.au</a> with their questions.
      Typically, the NationalMap does not store the data itself, but refers to the data servers of the data contributors,
      directly taking that data and presenting it overlaid over a map. Therefore, agencies providing data directly must have the data
      available via an online server using a standard protocol.</p>

      <h2>NationalMap Software</h2>

      <p>The NationalMap is an Open Source system available as a
      <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/nationalmap" target="_blank" >Github project</a>. The core software of this system was initially
      developed by NICTA for the NationalMap, but has subsequently been used for other projects. It has been made available
      to assist with the development of other spatial data viewing applications.</p>
