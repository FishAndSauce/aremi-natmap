These data were derived from spatial microsimulation using 2006 Census benchmarks (SPATIALMSM08b) applied to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Confidentialised Unit Record File data. For housing stress, the indicator is based on a commonly used measure of housing stress known as the 30/40 rule. Using this definition, a household is said to be in housing stress if it spends more than 30 per cent of its gross income on housing costs and if it also falls into the bottom 40 per cent of the equivalised disposable household income distribution. The poverty indicator represents the percentage of people in households where income is below the poverty line. The poverty line has been set at half the median OECD equivalised household disposable income. \n\nCite as: undefined: The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM) estimates of housing stress and estimates of poverty variables SLAs for Australia.\n\n# Attribute Description\n\n## sla_code\nsla_code Code of Statistical Local Area, as per ABS\n## sla_name\nsla_name Name of Statistical Local Area, as per ABS\n## housingstress_06\nPerc. of households in housing stress (2006)\n## housingstress_2010\nPerc. of households in housing stress (2010)\n## difference\nDifference of perc. of households in housing stress between 206 and 2010 (housingstress_2010 - housingstress_2006)\n## income_low \nPerc. of low income households (less than 65.000 AUD p.a.)\n## income_medium \nPerc. of middle income households (between 65.000 and 200.000 AUD p.a.)\n## income_high\nPerc. of high income households (more than 200.000 AUD p.a.)",
