Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>The map generated refers to potentially avoidable network investment and it shows the effective cost of addressing constraints through the preferred network solutions. Clicking on constrained areas will bring up a range of information. The annual value is an upper bound to the amount that could be spent on non-network options to alleviate a constraint. If less than this upper bound is spent addressing the constraint using non-network options such as CSP, then overall the cost to networks and consumers is lower. This does not necessarily reflect the value that networks are willing to pay for network support services, as this risk management equation is complex. <br/><br/>Areas in yellow are those with no deferral value. Areas in light orange are those with limited deferral value that is less than the average cost of network service provision (approximately $200-250/kVA/year). Marginal deferral values are high in the red to purple areas ($400-1000+/kVA/yr), which are the areas where CSP or other Demand Management can be highly attractive.<br/><br/>Using the time series information, by 2022 many of the deferral opportunities are shown to have disappeared. This is because the investment planned for many of those regions has been spent, eliminating the possibility of deferral. What these images do not show, however, is that wherever demand continues to grow, there would be new network investments appearing each year with updated network planning reports. Given that these values are unknown, they cannot be mapped and thus the annual marginal deferral value shows far less opportunities in 2022 than in 2012.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-1a.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/)"

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>The map generated refers to potentially avoidable network investment and it shows the effective cost of addressing constraints through the preferred network solutions. Clicking on constrained areas will bring up a range of information. The annual value is an upper bound to the amount that could be spent on non-network options to alleviate a constraint. If less than this upper bound is spent addressing the constraint using non-network options such as CSP, then overall the cost to networks and consumers is lower. This does not necessarily reflect the value that networks are willing to pay for network support services, as this risk management equation is complex. <br/><br/>Areas in yellow are those with no deferral value. Areas in light orange are those with limited deferral value that is less than the average cost of network service provision (approximately $200-250/kVA/year). Marginal deferral values are high in the red to purple areas ($400-1000+/kVA/yr), which are the areas where CSP or other Demand Management can be highly attractive.<br/><br/>Using the time series information, by 2022 many of the deferral opportunities are shown to have disappeared. This is because the investment planned for many of those regions has been spent, eliminating the possibility of deferral. What these images do not show, however, is that wherever demand continues to grow, there would be new network investments appearing each year with updated network planning reports. Given that these values are unknown, they cannot be mapped and thus the annual marginal deferral value shows far less opportunities in 2022 than in 2012.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-1a.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/)"

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - summer afternoon and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - summer afternoon and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - summer evening and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - summer evening and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - winter afternoon and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - winter afternoon and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - winter evening and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/><strong>These maps</strong> indicate that CSP could avoid the need for network augmentation in 48 locations, or 72% of the constrained locations examined. If only locations with solar resources better than 21 MJ/m2/day DNI are included, CSP could avoid the need for augmentation at 94% of locations.<ul><li>The coloured shapes mark the grid constraints in areas where the solar resource is sufficiently high to warrant the investigation of CSP.
