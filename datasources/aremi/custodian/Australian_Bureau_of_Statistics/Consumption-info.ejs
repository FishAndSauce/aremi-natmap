  "content": "This product presents summary information collected from the 2012 Household Energy Consumption Survey (HECS) and the Business Survey of Residential Electricity Distribution (BSRED), Experimental Estimates conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.<br/>The HECS collected information on household energy expenditure, consumption, behaviours, perceptions and other characteristics related to household energy use. Information is presented across key items of interest and also features longitudinal analysis on household energy efficient improvements. <h4>Rounding</h4> Where figures have been rounded, discrepancies may occur between sums of the component items and totals. Published percentages are calculated prior to rounding of the figures and therefore some discrepancy may exist between these percentages and those that could be calculated from the rounded figures. <h4>Inquiries</h4> For further information about these and related statistics, contact the National Information and Referral Service on 1300 135 070 or the Living Conditions Client Services team on Canberra (02) 6252 6174 or by emailing <a href='mailto:living.conditions@abs.gov.au'>living.conditions@abs.gov.au</a>.<br><br>
