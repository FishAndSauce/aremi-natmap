Where a constraint occurs in both seasons, the season with the largest capacity shortfall over the time horizon is mapped. <p>This map allows the user to see the progression of load growth relative to distribution zone substation capacity over time, and understand areas of emerging capacity-related constraint. Note that capacity constraints may exist at upstream or downstream of the zone substation and as such this map provides an indicative ‘slice’ of the capacity situation through one level of the network. Also note that these images show available capacity before network or non-network options are taken to alleviate constraints, and before load transfer capability between adjacent zones has been taken into account. <p>This map does NOT show: <ul><li>Areas facing power outage</li> <li>The capacity of the network to accept the connection of embedded or distributed generators</li></ul> <p>The green and yellow colours indicate a period when zones that have sufficient spare capacity (available capacity is around or above zero), while the orange and red colours (where available capacity is below zero) indicate periods where zones facing capacity-related constraints where investment will be needed to ensure reliability is maintained. <p>Polygons shown are approximate Zone Substation service regions.

      "content": "Taking into account the planned investments that are potentially deferrable – noting that many replacement investments are not nominated as deferrable – and the amount of network support (in MVA) from demand management or renewable energy required in a given year to achieve a successful deferral, Annual Deferral Value (expressed in $/kVA/year) is calculated. <p>Annual Deferral Value shows the effective cost of addressing upcoming network constraints through the preferred network solution. This annual value can be thought of as an upper bound to the amount that the network could invest in equivalent non-network options (such as demand management or distributed generation) to alleviate a constraint for that year. If less than this upper bound is spent addressing the constraint using non-network options, then overall the cost to network service providers and consumers is lower.  <p>Annual Deferral Values are indicative estimates which are subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done.  <strong>Annual Deferral Values are not what the Network Service Provider is willing to pay for demand management support.</strong>  Refer to the Network Service Provider’s Demand Side Engagement Document for details on how they assess non-network solutions and determine payment levels. <p>Areas in white are those with no deferral value. Areas in light yellow and brown are those with limited deferral value where very low cost demand management options may be viable. Annual deferral value increases strongly in the red to purple areas (>$400/kVA/yr). <p>Annual deferral value is calculated by determining the annualised value of deferring the network solution (avoided depreciation and interest paid on capital), and dividing this by the amount of network support (in kVA) that would be required in that year to achieve the deferral. Note that while the $/kVA/yr figure shown is a marginal value (i.e. for each kVA of capacity supplied), a whole year’s the demand growth is generally required in network support to enable a successful deferral to be achieved. That is, a sufficiently large quantum of network support is required. <p>From the investment year onwards the ADV shrinks if load growth is forecast to continue, as the amount of support required continues to increase, but the annualised value of depreciation and cost of capital remain unchanged. As such, the most lucrative time to invest in demand management tends to be the year of proposed investment. <p> When the user clicks on the distribution feeder region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box.
