      "content": "This is a map of ‘firm substation capacity’ (determined by the local reliability criteria), minus the forecast peak demand at the Zone Substation level. Data mapped is for the relevant critical peak season (summer or winter) at each Zone Substation. Where a constraint occurs in both seasons, the season with the largest capacity shortfall over the time horizon is mapped. <br/><br/> This map allows the user to see the progression of load growth relative to distribution zone substation capacity over time, and understand areas of emerging capacity-related constraint. Note that capacity constraints may exist at upstream or downstream of the zone substation and as such this map provides an indicative ‘slice’ of the capacity situation through one level of the network. Also note that these images show available capacity before network or non-network options are taken to alleviate constraints, and before load transfer capability between adjacent zones has been taken into account. <br/><br/> This map does NOT show: <br/><br/> •   Areas facing power outage <br/><br/> •   The capacity of the network to accept the connection of embedded or distributed generators <br/><br/> The green and yellow colours indicate a period when zones that have sufficient spare capacity (available capacity is around or above zero), while the orange and red colours (where available capacity is below zero) indicate periods where zones facing capacity-related constraints where investment will be needed to ensure reliability is maintained. <br/><br/> Polygons shown are approximate Zone Substation service regions. Clicking on a specific region will reveal the details of that location and time period, including the season of constraint and the exact available capacity value for each year."

      "content": "Taking into account the planned investments that are potentially deferrable – noting that many replacement investments are not nominated as deferrable – and the amount of network support (in MVA) from demand management or renewable energy required in a given year to achieve a successful deferral, Annual Deferral Value (expressed in $/kVA/year) is calculated. <br/><br/> Annual Deferral Value shows the effective cost of addressing upcoming network constraints through the preferred network solution. This annual value can be thought of as an upper bound to the amount that the network could invest in equivalent non-network options (such as demand management or distributed generation) to alleviate a constraint for that year. If less than this upper bound is spent addressing the constraint using non-network options, then overall the cost to network service providers and consumers is lower.  <br/><br/> Annual Deferral Values are indicative estimates which are subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done.  Annual Deferral Values are not what the Network Service Provider is willing to pay for demand management support.  Refer to the Network Service Provider’s Demand Side Engagement Document for details on how they assess non-network solutions and determine payment levels. <br/><br/> Areas in white are those with no deferral value. Areas in light yellow and brown are those with limited deferral value where very low cost demand management options may be viable. Annual deferral value increases strongly in the red to purple areas (>$400/kVA/yr). <br/><br/> Annual deferral value is calculated by determining the annualised value of deferring the network solution (avoided depreciation and interest paid on capital), and dividing this by the amount of network support (in kVA) that would be required in that year to achieve the deferral. Note that while the $/kVA/yr figure shown is a marginal value (i.e. for each kVA of capacity supplied), a whole year’s the demand growth is generally required in network support to enable a successful deferral to be achieved. That is, a sufficiently large quantum of network support is required. <br/><br/> In the years prior to the proposed investment year, the ADV shrinks as it discounted (at 7% p.a.) to reflect the lower value the network service provider could afford to invest in non-network options should be allowed to and choose to do so pre-emptively. From the investment year onwards, the ADV shrinks if load growth is forecast to continue, as the amount of support required continues to increase, but the annualised value of depreciation and cost of capital remain unchanged. As such, the most lucrative time to invest in demand management tends to be the year of proposed investment.  <br/><br/> When the user clicks on the distribution feeder region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. An explanation of the additional information is given below: <br/><br/> <ul> <li>Short name = The shorthand code used by network businesses to refer to the asset. </li><li>Asset type = Indicates the type of network asset according with the following definitions: <ul> <li>Transmission Line: High voltage power lines (including switching stations) built and operated by the transmission network service provider. </li><li>Transmission Terminal Station: High voltage transformation substation built and operated by transmission network service provider. </li><li>Sub transmission line: Subtransmission power line connecting transmission station and zone substation assets generally built and operated by distribution network service providers. </li><li>Sub transmission Substation: Transformation substation at the subtransmission voltage levels built and operated by transmission network service providers. </li><li>Distribution Zone Substation: Transformation substation typically (but not exclusively) converting voltage to 11kV on the low voltage side, built and operated by distribution network service providers. </li><li>Distribution feeder: Medium or high voltage feeder (eg. 22 kV or 11 kV) emerging from the zone substation to distribute power to downstream smaller, local distribution substations. </ul> </li><li>Network = name of the network business asset owner. </li><li>Annual Deferral Value in 2012 = the maximum value to the network of deferring the construction of the network asset for a year. </li><li>Potential NPV of avoided costs (2012) = the Net Present Value of the Annual Deferral Value if paid as a Network Support Payment for a period of 10 years. This equates to the potential maximum capital cost offset for a CSP plant. </li><li>Investment year = the year of commissioning of the planned network asset. </li><li>Capacity shortfall (investyr) = the capacity shortfall in the year that the network asset would be commissioned. </li><li>Capacity shortfall (worstyr) = the largest capacity shortfall in the 10 year period after the network asset commissioning year This equates to the minimum CSP plant capacity required to avoid the network investment. </li><li>Maximum potential for new generator = Approximate maximum size of generator that could be connected to the network at this location. </li><li>Constraint season = the primary season of constraint driving network investment (summer, winter or both). </li><li>Investment in = indicates whether the money is being spent at the ZS, TS or Stli. </li><li>Type of constraint = indicates whether the constraint is caused by growth, voltage support, or a change in security of supply licence requirements. </li><li>Notes = additional information on the proposed investment. </li></ul> "

      "content": "Augmentation investments in the network are undertaken to avoid peak demand reaching the capacity of network infrastructure. However, the peak demand of a network asset generally occurs only a few hours a year and hence it is useful to show the timing and magnitude of the constrained hours on the peak day. <br/><br/> This map layer shows the capacity exceedance (as a % of asset capacity) for each hour of the peak day in the lowest level of the network each area with potentially deferrable investment. That is, if the zone substation has deferrable value then the zone exceedance situation is mapped, while if the only deferrable value is at the transmission level, the transmission exceedance situation is mapped. <br/><br/> Note that the critical season (summer or winter) and year of investment (2016-2025) is different for each constraint area. As such, the peak day data mapped for each area is for the planned investment year* and the relevant peak season. This means that winter peaking zones may be more likely to show exceedance early and late in the day, and summer peaking zones to show value during the middle of the day and afternoon. <br/><br/> In the additional information (when a polygon is clicked), the exact exceedance values are shown both in MVA and MWh. <br/><br/> * If the first year that support is required is after the investment year, then the exceedance for this year is mapped."
