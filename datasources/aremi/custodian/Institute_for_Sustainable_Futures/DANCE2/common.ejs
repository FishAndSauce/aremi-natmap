  "content": "<strong>Plain English Disclaimer</strong> <br/><br/> These maps are intended to make data on electricity network planning and investment more accessible and consistent. These maps should not be used to make investment decisions, and should only be used to assist in discussions with the local Network Service Provider. You are free to use the data but do so at your own risk. By accessing or using the data the user agrees to irrevocably release Network Service Providers and UTS from all claims, actions, damages, judgments, losses, remedies or matters whether in tort, contract or under statute or otherwise, relating to the data. By proceeding, the user agrees and accepts the terms of the Full Legal Disclaimer shown below. <br/><br/> The 2015 release of these maps is a ‘sample’ version, designed to introduce Network Service Providers (data suppliers) and potential users to the tool, and obtain feedback to refine the mapping outputs.
