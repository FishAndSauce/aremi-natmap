For more than 60 years, TransGrid has been the manager and operator of the New South Wales high voltage electricity transmission network. Our core role is to provide safe, reliable and efficient transmission services to New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and National Electricity Market (NEM) customers. We connect generators, distributors and major end users to the New South Wales electricity transmission network. Generation and demand have differing impacts on the network system. We actively manage the changes to our network to enable the evolving energy landscape.

<p>This identification of opportunities is part of our collaborative approach to working with generators, providing customers with an indication of potential generator connection opportunities throughout NSW. Our objective is to promote and facilitate new developments with efficient and cost-effective connections. We have combined information from a range of sources to build a useful picture of the opportunities for additional generation in NSW. A series of underlying assumptions have been made to account for the continuously evolving electricity system.</p>

<p>Eight geographic locations across NSW were identified as opportunities for additional generation connections based on existing network capability and potential renewable resource strength. Indicative available generation capacities provided are based on the current peak demand, with all committed network and customer projects, and allowing for N-1 contingency compliance. It should be noted that there are a large number of generator connection enquiries in NSW, and the installation of new generation at a particular location could reduce the available connection capacity of the transmission network at adjacent locations.</p>
